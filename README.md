# Challenge?
## To Build a Random Quote Machine

## User Stories To Fullfill

- User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding ```id="quote-box"```.

- User Story #2: Within ```#quote-box```, I can see an element with a corresponding ```id="text"```.

- User Story #3: Within ```#quote-box```, I can see an element with a corresponding ```id="author"```.

- User Story #4: Within ```#quote-box```, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding ```id="new-quote"```.

- User Story #5: Within ```#quote-box```, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding ```id="tweet-quote"```.

- User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with ```id="text"```.

- User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with ```id="author"```.

- User Story #8: When the ```#new-quote``` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the ```#text``` element.

- User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the ```#new-quote``` button is clicked and display it in the ```#author``` element.

- User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the ```#tweet-quote``` ```a``` element. This ```a``` element should include the ```"twitter.com/intent/tweet"``` path in its ```href``` attribute to tweet the current quote.

- User Story #11: The ```#quote-box``` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

- Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the ```target="_blank"``` or ```target="_top"``` attribute on the ```#tweet-quote``` element if your tweet won't load ```target="_top"``` will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.
